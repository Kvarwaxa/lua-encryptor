# 🔐 Lua Encryptor
A lightweight tool to encrypt and obfuscate your Lua scripts — built for simplicity and speed.

## 🧠 Features
🔄 Multiple encryption methods:
XOR: Encrypt your code using a password/key.
Caesar Cipher: Shift letters by 3 positions (old-school but fun).
Old Method (Base64): Classic Base64 encoding/decoding.
🧩 Decrypt support – Works both ways.
📂 Open & Save Lua files.
💬 Info panel explaining how each encryption works.
🎨 Clean UI with dark tones and colored output for easy reading.
🐍 Built with Python & Tkinter – no bloat, just works.

## Encryption Method Descriptions
| Method         | Description                                                                    |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **XOR**        | Applies XOR logic between your code and a password key. Simple but effective.  |
| **Caesar**     | Shifts letters by 3 in the alphabet. super light obfuscation.                  |
| **Old Method** | Base64 encodes the Lua code. Reversible and fast, but not secure.              |
